Module 2 Challenge

I wrote down a plethora of comments for almost every line of code to help guide myself through each step and demonstrate my understanding of the logic behind the syntax used.
To better understand the logic behind each action, I reached out to fellow students via Study Groups and also utilized AskBCS Assistant which was vital in my progression in understanding not only this assignment but VBA scripting syntax in general.
